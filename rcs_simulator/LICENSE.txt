    adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
    transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from
    the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not
    be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the
    avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
    phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a
    moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the
    purpose of this License.
    
    b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such
    as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in
    Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of
    their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is
    included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
    contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in
    themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work
    that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as
    defined above) for the purposes of this License.
    
    c.  "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other
    transfer of ownership.
    
    d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
    
    e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
    the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or
    if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in
    addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
    play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
    expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
    being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
    performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
    organization that transmits the broadcast.
    
    f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
    terms of this License including without limitation any production in the
    literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
    form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet
    and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same
    nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or
    entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words;
    a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a
    process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,
    architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work
    to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
    photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch
    or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
    architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
    compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
    work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent
    it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
    
    g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
    respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
    Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
    violation.
    
    h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work
    and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means
    or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place
    individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any
    means or process and the communication to the public of the performances
    of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and
    rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
    
    i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
    protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
    medium.
    
    2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
    limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
    limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
    copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
    
    3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
    Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
    exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
    
    a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
    
    b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
    Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable
    steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes
    were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be
    marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
    modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
    
    c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
    in Collections; and,
    
    d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
    
    e. For the avoidance of doubt:
    
    i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
    which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
    licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
    right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
    granted under this License;
    
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
    the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
    licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
    to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
    under this License; and,
    
    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
    royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
    member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
    schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
    granted under this License.
    
    The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
    known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
    such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
    in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
    expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
    
    4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
    made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
    
    a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
    the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
    recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
    under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You
    must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
    disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You
    may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
    restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
    rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
    Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but
    this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
    made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
    remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
    requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor
    You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
    credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
    
    b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
    parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
    attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
    parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
    reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
    associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
    copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,
    consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
    identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
    translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
    original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
    4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
    that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit
    will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
    or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
    least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.
    For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
    Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
    by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
    explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
    endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,
    as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
    express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
    Attribution Parties.
    
    c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations
    or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
    derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
    the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
    jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted
    in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
    deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
    action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
    Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
    fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
    to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
    
    5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
    
    UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
    OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
    KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
    LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
    WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
    EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    
    6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
    LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
    ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
    ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
    BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
    7. Termination
    
    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
    
    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
    is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
    stated above.
    
    8. Miscellaneous
    
    a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
    Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
    on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
    this License.
    
    b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
    and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    
    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
    enforceable.
    
    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This
    License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
    appear in any communication from You.
    
    e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement
    of the Licensor and You.
    
    f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and
    the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These
    rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in
    which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the
    corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty
    provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of
    rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights
    not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
    included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the
    license of any rights under applicable law.
    
    Creative Commons Notice
    
    Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty
    whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be
    liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages
    whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
    incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this
    license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
    Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
    shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
    
    Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work
    is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use
    by either party of the trademark "Creative Commons" or any related
    trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent
    of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with
    Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be
    published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from
    time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, this trademark restriction
    does not form part of this License.

    Copyright 1996-2000 by
    David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
    
    
    
    Introduction
    ============
    
    The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
    some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
    various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
    FreeType Project.
    
    This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
    which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
    affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
    documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
    
    This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
    (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
    and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
    alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
    
    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
    interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
    
    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
    full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
    
    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
    it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
    somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
    FreeType code. (`credits')
    
    We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
    software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
    We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
    assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
    
    
    Legal Terms
    ===========
    
    0. Definitions
    --------------
    
    Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
    and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
    distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
    Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
    beta or final release.
    
    `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
    `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
    code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
    This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
    engine'.
    
    This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
    FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
    documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
    original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
    If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
    this license, you must contact us to verify this.
    
    The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
    Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
    specified below.
    
    1. No Warranty
    --------------
    
    THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
    WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
    BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
    USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
    
    2. Redistribution
    -----------------
    
    This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
    irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
    display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
    sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
    forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
    authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
    herein, subject to the following conditions:
    
    o Redistribution  of source code  must retain this  license file
    (`LICENSE.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes
    to   the  original   files  must   be  clearly   indicated  in
    accompanying  documentation.   The  copyright notices  of  the
    unaltered, original  files must be preserved in  all copies of
    source files.
    
    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
    states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
    FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
    encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
    documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
    
    These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
    the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
    our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
    to us.
    
    3. Advertising
    --------------
    
    Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
    the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
    purposes without specific prior written permission.
    
    We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
    following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
    or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
    `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
    
    As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
    accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
    material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
    authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
    Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
    Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
    of this license.

    --------------------------------
    
    2.1. Grants
    
    Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive license:
    
    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and
    
    (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.
    
    2.2. Effective Date
    
    The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
    become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
    distributes such Contribution.
    
    2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
    
    The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
    this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
    distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
    Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
    Contributor:
    
    (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or
    
    (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or
    
    (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.
    
    This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
    or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
    the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
    
    2.4. Subsequent Licenses
    
    No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
    distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
    License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
    permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
    
    2.5. Representation
    
    Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
    Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
    to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
    
    2.6. Fair Use
    
    This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
    applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
    equivalents.
    
    2.7. Conditions
    
    Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
    in Section 2.1.
    
    3. Responsibilities
    -------------------
    
    3.1. Distribution of Source Form
    
    All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
    Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
    the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
    Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
    License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
    attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
    Form.
    
    3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
    
    If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
    
    (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
    
    (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
    
    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
    
    You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
    provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
    the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
    Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
    Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
    License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
    under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
    the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
    Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
    License(s).
    
    3.4. Notices
    
    You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
    (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
    or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
    the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
    the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
    
    3.5. Application of Additional Terms
    
    You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
    Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
    behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
    such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
    You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
    liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
    disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
    jurisdiction.
    
    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
    ---------------------------------------------------
    
    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
    statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
    the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
    describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
    be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
    Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
    or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
    recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
    
    5. Termination
    --------------
    
    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
    if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
    compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
    Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
    Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
    ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
    non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
    come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
    Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
    notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
    first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
    from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
    Your receipt of the notice.
    
    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
    infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
    counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
    directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
    You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
    2.1 of this License shall terminate.
    
    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
    end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
    have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
    prior to termination shall survive termination.

    8. Litigation
    -------------
    
    Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
    courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
    place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
    jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
    Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
    cross-claims or counter-claims.
    
    9. Miscellaneous
    ----------------
    
    This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
    that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
    shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
    
    10. Versions of the License
    ---------------------------
    
    10.1. New Versions
    
    Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section

    distinguishing version number.
    
    10.2. Effect of New Versions

    steward.
    
    10.3. Modified Versions
    
    If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
    create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
    modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
    any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
    such modified license differs from this License).
    
    10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
    Licenses
    
    If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
    Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the

- OFL-1.1

    PREAMBLE
    The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
    development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
    efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
    open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
    with others.
    
    The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
    redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
    fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
    redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
    names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
    however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
    requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
    to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
    
    DEFINITIONS
    "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
    Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
    include source files, build scripts and documentation.
    
    "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
    copyright statement(s).
    
    "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
    distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
    
    "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
    or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
    Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
    new environment.
    
    "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
    writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
    
    PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
    a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
    redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
    Software, subject to the following conditions:
    
    1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
    in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
    
    2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
    redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
    contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
    included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
    in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
    binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
    
    3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
    Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
    Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
    presented to the users.
    
    4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
    Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
    Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
    Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
    permission.
    
    5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
    must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
    distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
    remain under this license does not apply to any document created
    using the Font Software.
    
    TERMINATION
    This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
    not met.
    
    DISCLAIMER
    THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
